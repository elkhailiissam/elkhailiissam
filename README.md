I build things, usually alone, usually the hard way.

I work across web, systems, and automation. Some days it’s backend code, some days it’s fixing something I broke the night before, some days it’s shipping a feature because people are actually using it.

A lot of what I build is commercial or startup work, so most real projects live in private repos. What’s public here is experiments, tools, and parts I’m allowed to show.

I care about:
- shipping things that don’t fall apart
- understanding how things work under the hood
- keeping code simple enough to survive future me
