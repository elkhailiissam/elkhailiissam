I build things, usually alone, usually the hard way.

I work across web, systems, and automation. Some days it’s backend code, some days it’s fixing something I broke the night before, some days it’s shipping a feature because people are actually using it.

A lot of what I build is commercial or startup work, so most real projects live in private repos. What’s public here is experiments, tools, and parts I’m allowed to show.

I care about:
- shipping things that don’t fall apart
- understanding how things work under the hood
- keeping code simple enough to survive future me

I don’t chase trends. I learn what I need, when I need it, and move on.

If you’re looking for flashy demos, this profile isn’t that.  
If you’re looking for someone who actually builds and maintains things, you’re in the right place.
